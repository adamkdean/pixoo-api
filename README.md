# Pixoo API

Pixoo API that doesn't suck.

This is a **work in progress**.

I've based this API on a number of sources, including the [Official Pixoo API](http://doc.divoom-gz.com/web/#/12?page_id=243) (which isn't great), a bunch of open source projects, and a lot of trial and error. Please open an issue if you find any bugs.

## Install

```
npm i pixoo-api
